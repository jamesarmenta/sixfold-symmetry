## body
To investigate the formation of snow crystals, and perhaps to advocate for the human ability to replicate natural, ordered beauty with deliberate, algorithmic design, contemporary mathematicians Janko Gravner and David Griffeath have produced computationally generated starlets, which they refer to as Snowfakes. Granver and Griffeath use the methods of a cellular automaton, similar to those portrayed in John Conway’s Game of Life, to account for physical variables such as temperature, pressure, and water vapor density in modeling the diffusive, freezing, attachment, and melting actions of individual water molecules in a matrix of three-dimensional space. Their model ultimately produces images of icy crystalline starlets as intricate and, arguably, as beautiful as their natural counterparts, like those captured by Wilson Bentley. Gravner and Griffeath’s Snowfakes also conform to the more than eighty types of snowflake crystals generated by nature and provide insight into the form and design of ice and other crystalline solids.
