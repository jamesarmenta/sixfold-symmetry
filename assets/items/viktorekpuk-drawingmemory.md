## body
Victor Ekpuk began investigating nsibidi, a secret written script of pictorial and abstract linear images, during his years of graduate study in studio art at the Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, Nigeria. Nsibidi gave him license to reject western-introduced artistic idioms in favor of African ones, and it disproved the largely Western belief, taught to him from childhood, that African cultures had no existing form of writing prior to the introduction of western script. Ekpuk sought to build on his familiarity with nsibidi by asking questions of the elders from his native Ibibio village and reading anthropological literature on the subject. However, he consciously chose not to be initiated into the secret Ekpe, or (Leopard Society), because such membership would prevent him from revealing its secrets. He prefers, instead, the role of outsider. His work evokes the dense and crowded aesthetic of nsibidi as often played out on ukara cloth, giving his viewers a complex display of imagery to decode. While his visual vocabulary has evolved into a very personal one — quite distinct from nsibidi — Ekpuk’s wall drawings mirror nsibidi’s impermanent and performative nature, both in his preferred use of an erasable chalk medium (a popular material for drawing nsibidi within Ekpe ritual circles) and in his practice of removing the murals from the wall at the end of exhibitions.
