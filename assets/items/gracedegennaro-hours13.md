Grace DeGennaro’s Hours 13 is part of a larger installation, Hours 9-16. This set of Hours continues DeGennaro’s exploration of time and space (Hours 1-8 are also featured in this exhibition). DeGennaro’s works are informed by the tenets of sacred geometry that describe types of growth found in the natural world. In particular, the artist uses the Fibonacci sequence. In this work, the central bead (or dot) of color represents 0. A quarter inch is used as a measurement for the concentric circles to move out from 1 to 2 dots, then 3, 5, 8, 13, and 21 dots (all Fibonacci numbers). The dots or beads of color have been a hallmark of DeGennaro’s paintings since 1997 and are a direct reference to the counting of beads, such as each bead marking the saying of a prayer on the Catholic rosary. The dots also reference Byzantine and Islamic mosaics, as well as Australian Aboriginal paintings and tattoos.
