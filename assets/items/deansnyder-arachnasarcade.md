## body
Orb weaver spiders construct wheel-shaped webs in gardens, fields, and forests. These two-dimensional silk structures, roughly circular in shape, have a series of radii arranged like spokes from a central hub, forming a framework for the spiral of sticky silk used to trap prey. Both the web’s material, tougher than Kevlar, and design contribute to its remarkable ability to stop high-speed flying insects without breaking. Dean Snyder’s web, based on nocturnal photographs of orb weaver webs he took in Hawaii, is a drawing in space, with the deceptively fragile-looking silk translated into highly polished steel. Though the scale shifts in Arachna’s Arcade, the steel makes the web appear almost photographic, transposing the garden into the gallery.
