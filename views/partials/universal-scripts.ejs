These two-dimensional silk structures, roughly circular in shape, have a series of radii arranged like spokes from a central hub, forming a framework for the spiral of sticky silk used to trap prey. Both the web’s material, tougher than Kevlar, and design contribute to its remarkable ability to stop high-speed  ying insects without breaking. Dean Snyder’s web, based on nocturnal photographs of orb weaver webs he took in Hawaii, is a drawing in space, with the deceptively fragile-looking silk translated into highly polished steel. Though the scale shifts in Arachna’s Arcade, the steel makes the web appear almost photographic, transposing the garden into the gallery.',faculty: 'R. Seligman',slug: 'deansnyder-arachnasarcade',views: 25 },{ title: 'Tree',year: '1990',description: 'Color aquatint on four sheets of Somerset paper \nCollection of the Tang Teaching Museum,\nGift in Memory of Susan Sollins, 2016.12.3',artist: 'Joel Fisher',images: [ 'joelfisher_tree0' ],body: 'Joel Fisher’s work builds on itself in recursive cycles of self-reference. Fisher begins by making his own handmade paper. Inherent in the paper are tiny hair-like  bers, which early on caught Fisher’s eye. Fisher copies and enlarges selected  bers in pencil on paper. He calls these drawings “apographs,” a term he describes as “a complicated word for a copy that carries with it a sense of separation.” Fisher’s term also relates to the word apophenia, or the human tendency to discern meaningful patterns where there may not be any, as within random data. Fisher then translates his apograph drawings into three-dimensions, usually bronze sculptures, creating organic forms resembling dancing  gures or trees.\n\nFor Tree, Fisher extended his iterative process by photographing his 1987 sculpture, Study for a Tree, and enlarging the image until it became pixelated. He re-created this image with four hundred square plates of color aquatint and matched the colors to the shade of each pixel in the photograph. With the print Tree, Fisher circles back to a two-dimensional image, but locks the organic form into a grid-based structure, calling to mind digital media. He also brings us back to the apograph, inviting us to discover an underlying pattern in what may or may not be simply random data.',faculty: 'R. Seligman',slug: 'joelfisher-tree',views: 15 },{ title: 'Energy Sca olds and Information Architecture (Return to Formlessness)',year: '2015',description: 'Color pencil and graphite on antique ledger book pages\nCourtesy of the artist and Nicelle Beauchene Gallery',artist: 'Dean Snyder',images: [ 'louisedespont_energyscaffolds0' ],body: 'Louise Despont makes intricate pencil drawings on antique ledger paper using architectural stencils. The ledgers, originally used to keep track of expenses and accounts, serve a new purpose in Despont’s work, accounting for time; as she puts it, “an account of every day that I put into the drawing... a life spent.” This daily practice, she says, has yielded surprising discoveries: “To be focused and dedicated to doing one simple thing can perhaps be the most transformative thing. That as narrow as it is, it can be in nitely deep.”\n\nEach drawing emerges organically, beginning with a few marks on paper, but with no formal plan. According to Despont, the drawing guides itself. “It’s a complexity that you can’t think up. It’s like little mineral deposits build up and make an entire surface.” Her drawings, some on single sheets, and some extending across multiple sheets, appear controlled and detailed, but for Despont, each drawing is a process of discovery, with a larger, universal force guiding the emerging patterns. This intuitive process generates imagery that is symmetrical, highly geometric, and possessed of an expressive energy that she feels is connected to both the spiritual realm and to nature.\n\nDespont lives part of each year in Bali, and the black and white grids with diamond shapes that  ank the central drawing — a pattern Despont refer to as “Eyes of Consciousness”— bears striking similarity to the traditional Balinese cloth called kain poleng, used to wrap sacred objects. This cloth, like all Balinese textiles, is a material “through which the divine nature of the universe and its material manifestations are recognized and expressed.” You can  nd an example of this fabric in the exhibition on the perimeter of the mat on which the gamelan sits.',faculty: 'R. Seligman',slug: 'louisedespont-energyscaffolds',views: 29 },{ title: 'Ukara Cloth',description: 'Cotton and indigo dye\nCollection of Toby and Barry Hecht',artist: 'Members of the Ezillio Community',images: [ 'membersezillio_ukaracloth0' ],body: 'Nsibidi is a written script or language consisting of a forever-expanding lexicon of pictorial and abstract line images that are both displayed and used in performance by the social elite. From the Cross River region bordering Nigeria and Cameroon, the nsibidi language falls within the privileged domain of men’s secret governing organizations known as the Ekpe (or Leopard Society). Archaeological remains of ceramic sculptures, vessels, and headrests bearing nsibidi-like patterns suggest that this ritualized visual language goes back at least one thousand years. Nsibidi is expressed in male performances, played out through a series of gestures and movements that only the initiated can understand.\n\nThe ukara cloth on display here presents a small portion of nsibidi’s larger lexicon. The pictographs are organized in rows, as is typical, but are not read in any particular sequence. Instead, each refers to a particular meaning associated with power, status, and social relations within Ekpe contexts. One of the older, often repeated nsibidi signs consists of intersecting half circles that represent ideas of love and amicable companionship. When not overlapping, the two half circles mean just the opposite, a social rift, divorce, or con ict. Other nsibidi designs refer to Ekpe social spaces, and still others the material culture associated with membership in these organizations, including palm fronds, sta s of o ce, and metal gongs. There are also images of animals, whose behaviors and associative powers are used by Ekpe members to learn life skills and exert their authority. However, only in the deeper meanings of these motifs, known strictly to Ekpe members, is nsibidi fully understood.',faculty: 'L. Aronson',slug: 'membersezillio-ukaracloth',views: 25 },{ title: 'Drawing Memory',year: '2016',description: 'Black paint and chalk \nCourtesy of the artist',artist: 'Victor Ekpuk',images: [ 'victorekpuk_drawingmemory0', 'victorekpuk_drawingmemory1' ],body: 'Victor Ekpuk began investigating nsibidi, a secret written script of pictorial and abstract linear images, during his years of graduate study in studio art at the Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, Nigeria. Nsibidi gave him license to reject western-introduced artistic idioms in favor of African ones, and it disproved the largely Western belief, taught to him from childhood, that African cultures had no existing form of writing prior to the introduction of western script.\n\nEkpuk sought to build on his familiarity with nsibidi by asking questions of the elders from his native Ibibio village and reading anthropological literature on the subject. However, he consciously chose not to be initiated into the secret Ekpe, or (Leopard Society), because such membership would prevent him from revealing its secrets. He prefers, instead, the role of outsider. His work evokes the dense and crowded aesthetic of nsibidi as often played out on ukara cloth, giving his viewers a complex display of imagery to decode. While his visual vocabulary has evolved into a very personal one — quite distinct from nsibidi — Ekpuk’s wall drawings mirror nsibidi’s impermanent and performative nature, both in his preferred use of an erasable chalk medium (a popular material for drawing nsibidi within Ekpe ritual circles) and in his practice of removing the murals from the wall at the end of exhibitions.',faculty: 'L.
